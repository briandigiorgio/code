To Do:

9/12:
-take a slice of of M_i and plot some metric for bulge size vs. asymmetric
drift for similar M_i
  -find correlation with ranked correlation in scipy (spearman)
-fit a line to M_i vs. AD and subtract away to find dAD, see how that changes
with bulge size
-if using a different catalog, must take plate number/IFU number and match up
with ra/dec in DRPall file to get ra/dec of galaxy
 -ra/dec may match up to different plate/ifu since some galaxies are observed
multiple times

10/1:
-ad vs. sersic index 
  -see if there is even a free variable
  -at multple Re's
-look ad profile in 5 different bins of absolute magnitude
  -magnitude quintiles
  -median/mean ad value at Re step

10/24:
-fix error using weighted standard deviation
-look at colors of highest mass galaxies, see if color N-r correlates with AD
-replot everything with ad/(ha rotation speed) harc_em
-for a given Re, plot average bulge to total vs average ad in 5 mag bins

10/31
-kd tree, spherical match
-sersic drpall vs sersic prob

11/22
-sersic drpall vs sersic prob, continue troubleshooting
-remake adquints with stellar mass
  -gives weird reversed graph
-look at ad profiles for different quintiles

2/12
-bars
-make fit line linear
-look at diff between fit line for each and total
-magnitude slices
-gz2
-pipe3d, firefly sloan vac mass profile
  -mass contained with radius
  -mass just at the radius
  -nsa mag 
 
Scicon 3/5:
  -lihwai lin:
    -enhancement of sfr for close galaxy pairs (ellison 08 sdss)
    -lin 07 (deep2): not all interactions boost sfr
    -cox 08: simulations show enhancement in sfr on first pass but mainly on
    final merge
    -merger classification 1-4
      -1: approaching, no interaction yet
      -2: right after first passage, tidal tails
      -3: second approach, little distortion
      -4: indistinguishable components
    -main sequence: stellar surface brightness related to Ha surf bright
      -class 1 agrees with main sequence for general galaxies, maybe some
      suppression
      -class 2 agreement, no enhancement
      -more enhancement for class 3 and class 4
    -post starburst galaxies/quenching:
      -5 examples of post starburst spectrum in post merger galaxies out of
      117, so rare
      -mostly on outskirts/tidal tails, in late stage
  -zheng zheng:
    -FAST/TBT: proposal to follow up manga galaxies in 21cm, funding from
    China, still in commissioning
      -Karen Masters: observing, this wants to get postdocs/students
  -Dave Stark
     -GBT data: 2000 galaxies already, DR1 this summer
