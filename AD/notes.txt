To Do:

9/12:
-take a slice of of M_i and plot some metric for bulge size vs. asymmetric
drift for similar M_i
  -find correlation with ranked correlation in scipy (spearman)
-fit a line to M_i vs. AD and subtract away to find dAD, see how that changes
with bulge size
-if using a different catalog, must take plate number/IFU number and match up
with ra/dec in DRPall file to get ra/dec of galaxy
 -ra/dec may match up to different plate/ifu since some galaxies are observed
multiple times

10/1:
-ad vs. sersic index 
  -see if there is even a free variable
  -at multple Re's
-look ad profile in 5 different bins of absolute magnitude
  -magnitude quintiles
  -median/mean ad value at Re step

10/24:
-fix error using weighted standard deviation
-look at colors of highest mass galaxies, see if color N-r correlates with AD
-replot everything with ad/(ha rotation speed) harc_em
-for a given Re, plot average bulge to total vs average ad in 5 mag bins

10/31
-kd tree, spherical match
-sersic drpall vs sersic prob

11/22
-sersic drpall vs sersic prob, continue troubleshooting
-remake adquints with stellar mass
  -gives weird reversed graph
-look at ad profiles for different quintiles

2/12
-bars
  -no correlation (barad)
-make fit line linear (liercut l=-17)
  -cliers show steeper relation overall that sf
  -in ad/h, cliers stay flat but sf trend upward at lower mag end
-look at diff between fit line for each and total

-magnitude slices (liercut)
  -sfcl##: slices of higher magnitudes, wild variability but in general cliers
  are steeper at high end especially in center (best seen in -21)
  -sfcl##h: murkier in ad/h but still seen in -21 (suspicious) 
-gz2
-pipe3d, firefly sloan vac mass profile
  -mass contained with radius
  -mass just at the radius
  -nsa mag 
 
Scicon 3/5:
  -lihwai lin:
    -enhancement of sfr for close galaxy pairs (ellison 08 sdss)
    -lin 07 (deep2): not all interactions boost sfr
    -cox 08: simulations show enhancement in sfr on first pass but mainly on
    final merge
    -merger classification 1-4
      -1: approaching, no interaction yet
      -2: right after first passage, tidal tails
      -3: second approach, little distortion
      -4: indistinguishable components
    -main sequence: stellar surface brightness related to Ha surf bright
      -class 1 agrees with main sequence for general galaxies, maybe some
      suppression
      -class 2 agreement, no enhancement
      -more enhancement for class 3 and class 4
    -post starburst galaxies/quenching:
      -5 examples of post starburst spectrum in post merger galaxies out of
      117, so rare
      -mostly on outskirts/tidal tails, in late stage
  -zheng zheng:
    -FAST/TBT: proposal to follow up manga galaxies in 21cm, funding from
    China, still in commissioning
      -Karen Masters: observing, this wants to get postdocs/students
  -Dave Stark
     -GBT data: 2000 galaxies already, DR1 this summer

3/20
-plot cut of bulge fraction with ad mag
-plot hist of sf and cl, also plot means in mag bins
  -no hist: lieravg(h).png liermean.py
    -few differences except some dip in cliers in h in mid radii
  -hist: lierhist*h.png lierhist.py
    -shows some bimodality in dist of cliers in middle radii
-get francesco's clier control sample
-change color scheme
  -done, matches francesco's 2016 papers

3/26
-get sig1, concentration from francesco
-bulge cut
-bimodality:
  -look at rotation curves for diff population
    -just looking at cLIERS vs SF (lierprofs.png): cliers have higher gas
    rotation speed and stellar rotation speed than sf but not by much
    -cutting in trough: log(ad^2/h^2) < -.6 at 1Re
      -lierprofsall.png, lierprofssc: cliers below cut behave similarly to sf, 
      cliers above have much higher rotation speeds and ad in largest bin, 
      similar/flipped in lower bins (?)
  -cut by mean, trough
-pipe3d/firefly mass within a radius, surface mass density vs ad
-kyle sees ad profile for high mass galaxies flatten out at 10^4 (slack plot)


4/4:
-look at velocity profiles of all of the individual galaxies in the highest
Mag bin for each of the 4 populations (cut/no cut for clier,sf) to see if
there are overall differences or just outliers
-look at velocity field data for these galaxies too
-gas rotation speed vs mag for fixed radius (tully fisher), color by sf/clier
or by b/a galaxy or inclination tilt to see if there are separate populations
  -difference in inclination would be due to dust obscuration lowering
  magnitude or bad velocity measurement
