1.create a grid of square pixels over the top of a gaussian psf, see how S/N
changes with different pixel sizes
  -keep total size of the grid to 1", see how much flux falls outside of grid
    -maybe vary total grid size
  -go from 1 large pixel to many smaller pixels
  -use optimal extraction algorition from Naylor 1998
  -use function of actual psf for optimal extraction
  -use convolution instead of 2d integration: 
    -convolve a square aperture with gaussian at pixel locations
2. Do same thing with hexagonal aperture
3. Fit the data to see how well the actual psf can be recovered

11/22:
-no noise on theoretical psf
-apply sky noise and poisson error at same time on signal coming out of
instrument


12/13:
-run a bunch of s/n simulations and look at the variance in the returned
fluxes to see how it compares to reported error (snvar.py)
  -calculated variance agrees well with observed variance, difference on the
  order of 10
  -flux from opt ext is less than flux from aperture, gulf gets larger with
  more fibers
  -S/N from aperture is actually better than from 
-see if the opt ext sn is actuall 10% better than aperture (snvar.py)
  -S/N from aperture is actually larger than the S/N from optext because the
  flux is systematically larger and the variance is the same
  -how do you calculate the s/n for an aperture sum? Something is wrong
-make plot of sn for different fiber number for different flux compared
to background (opt ext and aperture) (fluxcomp.py)
  -more fibers leads to a much larger improvement in s/n for lower noise ratios
  than for higher noise ratios
  -aperture values don't behave as expected so are probably wrong

1/10:
-the value in the fluxcomp graph at fibers = 1 is 10000/sqrt(10000+noise^2),
if you normalize by this you can see marginal gains for adding more fibers
  -looks way too cluttered if you do that
-also loglog that

2/12:
-slide for context on psf
-slide for context on noise
-hexagonal 1 bundle
-raise psf resolution to see effect
-say what being held constant and what is varying
-rewrite noise in terms of what sky flux would result in
that amount of random noise (noise^2)
  -ratio of flux to sky background

2/28:
-focus on S/B of ~100
-remake all graphs with fwhm on x axis ranging from .4-.9
  -rectfwhm.py, fwhms100.png show expected results
-expand range of pixel size to see if trend is what it should be on slit
  -yep

3/23:
-look at aperture losses for .75x1 slit, .25, 19 fiber bundle with .33 r3 
dimension
-plot aperture loss for different fwhm for different designs
  -losscomp, apertures.png


4/4:
-for sersic, assume Re of .2" and .8" for galaxies at z=1, n = 1,4
  -convolve moffat psf with sersic profile
-fix radius vs diameter in truncation plot
